      <description>Intro In this chapter we&amp;rsquo;re going to add support for stack frames. Here I&amp;rsquo;ve made some notes while reading this chapter to make sure I understand things clearly.
Stack A stack is a region of memory that grows downward and shrinks upward (like icicles). The top of the stack is it&amp;rsquo;s lowest memory address. We treat the stack as a big array, with a special register &amp;ndash; the stack pointer (SP).</description>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve started reading the book by Andrew W. Appel titled Modern compiler implementation in ML. I&amp;rsquo;ve picked it up because I&amp;rsquo;ve heard some really good reviews about the ML version of it. Also there are other editions available that use C and Java. Each chapter covers a single phase of the compilation process and comes with some initial ML code and programming excercies. At the end you will have a working optimizing compiler.</description>

      <description>Hello! My name is Vasiliy Yorkin and this is my personal website.
I&amp;rsquo;m interested in statically typed functional programming, type theory and formal verification. These days I spend most of my time exploring the world of FP and category theory.
I&amp;rsquo;ve started to learn functional programming for real in winter 2017, when Haskell caught my interest and a couple of months later I had a chance to use it at work.</description>
