      <description>Intro Link to heading We need a way to translate a program written in one (human-friendly) language to another (machine-specific) language. Generally, this work is splitted into 2 parts: analysis and synthesis.&#xA;The synthesis-part (back end) is responsible for the code generation and optimizations.&#xA;Analysis-part (front end) is responsible for breaking the program apart to understand its structure and meaning. There are 3 commonly used analysis phases:&#xA;Lexical – breaking a sequence of characters into sequence of individual tokens (words) Syntax – parsing and checking that we have a valid sequence of tokens Semantic – gathering the program’s meaning, making sure that declarations and statements of program are semantically correct, this usually includes type checking In this post we’ll focus on implementing the lexical analysis phase.</description>
